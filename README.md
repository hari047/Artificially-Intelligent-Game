# Artificially-Intelligent-Game

### An artificially intelligent game that performs reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Q-learning to learn to how to navigate across (play) the 8x8 grid in the game.  

### Implemented a neural network as a Q-function resulting in an increase in processing capabilities and a reduction in general overhead of constantly having to look into a Q-table. 

### The agent of the artificially intelligent game reached the goal state in the least possible steps just like how a human would.
